                    <h3 id="about-h1-1st-subtitle" class="h1-h3">The guitar</h3>

                    <p>The story begins in <em>Hamburg</em>, north part of <em>Germany</em>. Who said forced love stories do not have happy endings? While playing with toys, like any other kid, my father brought to me one day a <span>guitar</span>. I didn’t have much choice, because of my conformable behavior.</p><br>

                    <p>Well, we don’t have to wait until the beginning of the good part of the love story. The gift was followed by <em>ten years of musical education</em>. I started loving every minute of it. I couldn’t just practice it alone. At the age of 8 I thought it was time to join forces with two other boys and start the band “Girls-free-zone”.

                    <h3 class="h1-h3">The popularity</h3>

                    <p>After two years I knew I had made a mistake. Girls started to become friendly, irritated by the band’s neglection. I got in another band of German Pop-Rock, singing about the problems of being a kid. It was a tough life and it deserved some songs.</p><br>

                    <p>I always liked diversity. At 13 years old I joined a <em>metal-core</em> band. 4 years of making music for the cool kids that I hanged out with, following the local trends. All-time-low had a big impact on me, so I changed the style to more punk. I wanted to target more people than before and played punk covers, while playing around and creating new original songs.

                    <p>The story is almost close to the present. I, Jonas F. Menke, relocated in sunny Copenhagen at the age of 21 and decided to be the change in the music industry that I dreamed of. I want to become a popular singer and songwriter, while playing his acoustic guitar. </p><br>


                    <p>There is a gap that I am trying to fill in the music industry, and that is the genre I play: <em>indie-pop</em>. Even though I want to make a living out of music, the reason why it keeps me going is that <em>THIS IS HAPPINESS TO ME.</em>
